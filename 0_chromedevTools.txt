Render blocking: both css and JS can cause it.
- download, parse and then execute the css/js before proceeding.

Get rid of any render blocking that isn't truly needed.
First, we need to find it:

- Audits -> run Audits (using lighthouse)
	-- Opportunities-section
		> Eliminate Render Blocking Resources
		Press ctrl+shift+P(p?) on windows/linux 
		1.	-- it opens the "command menu"
			-- type "coverage" + click "show coverage" ===> A new "Coverage" tab will be opened.
				Click reload (In the "Coverage" Tab) 
				
				Then it will show "how much code, from each file is unused"
					-- click on jquery.js file.
					-- the red bar means those lines were not executed 
					
		2. Press Ctrl+Shift+P and type "block" and select "Show Request Blocking" 
			(Some of the libraries may not be used at all)
			> Click "Add Pattern"
			> /libs/* 
			> go back to the network pannel and reload the page.
				-- it will show which js-scripts were "render blocking" and are highlighted in red.
