AWS Lambda Service:-
	- is a serverless compute service that will create the response 
	- No need to validate incoming requests 
	- No need to maintain ssl certificates, etc. 
	- supports Java, Node.js, C#, Python code.
AWS Free Tier
	- 1million requests per month + 3.2m secs of compute time per month.
	
eg. 
AWS Lambda function (using Node.js):-
	- http://aws.amazon.com 
	- country matters, so select country properly else you wont get enough trigger points. 
	- search for lambda + click on lambda + click "create function"
		- template to select is "SimpleMicroServices"
